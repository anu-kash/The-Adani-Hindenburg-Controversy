# Network Analytics ft. Adani Saga 2023

Let's focus our attention towards one of the most influential and successful businessman from India who rose to a global recognition as he rocked the top charts of being one of the richest people in the world. However, recently, <b>Gautam Adani</b>, the chairman and founder of the Adani Group has been accused of some trickery and we decided to take that up as our network analytics project topic. We went ahead and analyzed how twitteratis reacted to the whole situation and not surprisingly, it looks like another political debate in the country. 

<b>Let's get some context before we dive into the analytics part:</b> \
Adani is a big name not only in India but also globally. It’s been about three weeks since Hindenburg, a New York-based short-selling firm, accused Adani Group of “pulling the largest con in corporate history” through stock manipulation, and accounting fraud. In response to Hindenburg’s allegations, Adani Group issued a 413-page reply calling the short-sellers claims “stale, baseless, and discredited allegations.” This spiked a sort-of political debate in the country and people started questioning whether the political leaders in power had something to do with these Adani scams. We started witnessing a ton of twitter riots, the obvious memes, and also the propagation of speculated information that lacks evidence. 

The allegations have nevertheless had an immediate knock-on effect, with more than $100 billion wiped from the group’s market value, as well as Gautam Adani losing his status as both Asia and India’s richest man. With the context set, now we proceed to the analysis.


Objective: Analyzing influencer networks supporting vs opposing Adani 
● Identified hashtags in support vs against the matter and created two separate channels for analysis
● Detected influencers in the two networks on the basis of centrality measures and account engagement metrics
